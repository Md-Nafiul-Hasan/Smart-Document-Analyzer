SAMPLE DOCUMENT FOR TESTING

This is a sample document used for testing the Smart Document Analyzer system.

The document contains multiple paragraphs with different types of content to test
the parsing and analysis capabilities of the system.

Key Features:
- Document processing with multiple file formats
- AI-powered analysis including sentiment analysis
- Entity extraction and keyword identification
- Cloud-native architecture using AWS Lambda
- Scalable and maintainable design using OOP principles

This system demonstrates best practices in:
1. Object-oriented programming with abstract base classes
2. Design patterns such as Strategy pattern
3. AWS Lambda integration
4. Document processing workflows

The analyzer can process various document types and extract valuable insights
from the content using machine learning techniques.

Sample Numbers: 42, 123, 999
Sample Names: John Smith, Jane Doe, AWS

This implementation showcases modern Python development practices with proper
error handling, logging, and unit testing capabilities.
